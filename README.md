**Background**
-
  This NBA player performance analysis was conducted to better understand the factors that 
influence player and team performance during the regular season period from November 2023 to 
January 2024. In a professional sports competition like the NBA, understanding performance metrics 
and game dynamics is critical for coaches, team managers and data analysts to develop effective 
strategies, identify strengths and weaknesses, and improve overall performance.

  The data used in this analysis includes various player statistics, including points per game 
(PTS), assists (AST), blocks (BLK), steals (STL), rebounds (REB), 2-point shots (2P), 3-point shots 
(3P), free throws (FT), field goals (FG), turnovers (TOV), and personal fouls (PF). These metrics were 
chosen for their relevance in evaluating a player's efficiency and effectiveness on the court. For 
example, metrics such as 2P, 3P, FT, and FG give an idea of the ability to score points, while AST, 
BLK, STL, and REB provide insight into a player's contribution in the aspects of defense and ball 
distribution.

  In addition, this analysis also considers the playing positions and specific contributions of 
various roles in the team, such as power forwards (PF), small forwards (SF), centers (C), shooting 
guards (SG), and point guards (PG). Understanding how each position contributes to the team's overall 
performance can help in determining a more optimal strategy and player rotation. For example, PF, SF, 
and C players tend to block and rebound more often, while SG and PG focus more on scoring points 
and providing assists.

  This monthly performance analysis also aims to identify trends and changes in team 
performance throughout the season. By observing performance from November 2023 to January 2024, 
this analysis can provide insights into how teams and players adapt to changing competition conditions, 
as well as identify factors that contribute to improved or decreased performance.

  Overall, this analysis aims to provide deep insights into the performance dynamics of NBA 
players and teams, and support better decision-making in game strategy and team management. This 
analysis is also expected to help teams optimize game strategies, improve the effectiveness of defense 
and attack, and maximize the potential of individual players to achieve the best performance.
